Welcome to the incredible world of BRRRR-NFC. 
        Brought to life at 755550 by the wonderful team of the <a href="https://youtu.be/zVYvrQhiWUU">Connect the World Podcast</a>.

        As the very first web version in bitcoinland I will help you to <b>batchwise</b> set up everything you need to produce a bunch of neat Lightning
        NFC-Cards for your event. And I am awesome in doing so. Seriously.

        Machines set up, where your customers can pay via Lightning and NFC and now you need those cards ? 
        Want to offer some Voucher or tipping NFC Cards for your event ?


        Note:
        NFCCards with NTAG 216 can carry just 1 written link - usually this would be the one to pay with. 
        But that´s not enough, right ? To be able to refill the card or see the balance NFC-BRRR can generate stickers 
        carrying an Import-Key for e.g. BlueWallet for each card. 
        Put the right(!) sticker on each card or a corresponding flyer and your guests are set to use some juice- or beertaps !


        Let´s get your wallets and stickerfile ready and BRRRR some cards !
